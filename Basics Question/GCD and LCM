GCD-> greatest common divisor.
We have given two numbers
36     24
And we have to find that max number which will divide both

Brute force techniques is that the number which is smaller than both .Here (24)
So, we start loop from 24 to 2. And the number which first divide the both 36 and 24 will be the result.
There is second methos also i.e divison method.


(n2)24)---36(n1)----
     -24
     ----
      12(rem))--24--
               -24
               ----
                0
               ----
          Jab tak 0 nhi aata we have to divide.Jo last divisor zero leke aata hai vo ans.


import java.util.Scanner;
public class HelloWorld{

     public static void main(String []args){
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int n1=sc.nextInt();
        int n2=sc.nextInt();
        int on1=n1;
        int on2=n2;
        while(n1%n2!=0)
        {
            int rem=n1%n2;
            n1=n2;
            n2=rem;
        }
        System.out.println("GCD: "+n2);
        System.out.println("LCM: "+(on1*on2)/n2); // LCM=(n1*n2)/gcd
        
        
         
     }
}
