Algo: A set of steps to accomplish a task. For example : for making a grilled sandwhich we use certain algo. Or for going to school we also use some algo.
What makes a algo good? -> 1) correctnes 2) efficiency.
Correctness means how accuractly that algorithm is giving ans.

Ques?
How do we check the efficiency of an algo?-> If we talk about the time which algo is taking to execute it will give the time just on the basis of input given.So,
computer scientist use asymptotic analysis.
Ques?
What algorithms do you think are used by your favorite games and apps?
