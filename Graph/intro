1) A graph just like tree is a collection of nodes or entities connected to each other through the edges.
2) In the tree there is certain rules for the edges. If there are n nodes then there is only n-1 edges and in the tree each node has a parent node except the root
   node.
3) But in graph there are no rules in dictating the connection among the nodes.
4) There is proper way for reaching root node to leaf node in a tree.
5) So, tree is a special kind of graph.
6) How ot represent a edge? Two types 1) Directed(Connection is one way) 2) Undirected 
7) A graph with the directed edges is directed graph and another one is undirected graph.
8) Real example of graph is social media platform . As we use facebook , So we all are connected to each other. Suppose i am friend of you and you are friend of 
   person C . So, in suggestion I can see the person C also.
9) Another example ofdirected graph is that www.(World wide web). As we type the link in the url part so, it will redirect us to  pageA. Suppose page A has 
    the link and it will redirect us to page B. But we are not sure that the page B also has the url of page A.
10) Algoritm in graphs are?
