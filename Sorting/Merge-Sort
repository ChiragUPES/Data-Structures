What is a merge? Merging is combining two sorted list into a single list.
Let's Say we have two sorted list and we have to merge them into the third one.
              A             B                   C
         i->  2             5 <-j                2     <-k
         i->  8             9 <-j                5     <-k 
         i->  15            12<-j                8     <-k
         i->  18            17<-j                9     <-k
                                                12     <-k
                                                15     <-k
                                                17     <-k
                                                18     <-k
                                                
              
Logic: Compare A[i] with B[j]. Which one is smaller put into the third one. and than increase smaller pointer and k pointer.This process continues and in the end we have 
       to just remainig elements which are left.
       Talking about time complexity of this process , if there are n elements in A array and m elements in B array. So we are just simply comparing them and result 
       them into sorted array. So it will be Theta(n+m);

Algorithm:  Merge(A,B,m,n)`// where m and n are the sizes of the given arrays
            {
              int i=1;j=1;k=1;
             while(i<=m && j<=n)            
             {
                if(A[i]<B[j])
                {
                    C[k]=A[i];
                    i++;
                    k++;
                 }
                  else
                  {
                    C[k]=B[j];
                    k++;
                    j++;
                   
                  }
            }
            // Now we have to work for the remaining elements. present in the array
            for(;i<=m;i++)
            {
              C[k]=A[i];
              k++;
            }
            for(;j<=n;j++)
            {
              C[k]=B[j];
              k++;
            }
            
             }
this while loop is for comparing and coping elements. and for loop is for that if there are any remainig elements than we have to copy that elements.              
              
              
              
              
              
Based on divide and conquer Algorithm.
What is divide and conquer algorithm? Divide and conquer ALgorthm is a technique to divide a problem into subproblem using recursion and than solve the subproblem. 
                                      And on the basis of subproblem we can solve the problem.

When a single array is given,we will divide that array into smaller pieces until it reaches to one element and than we start merging again .
