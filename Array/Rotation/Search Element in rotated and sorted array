As we know if the array is sorted ,than through binary search we can easily find the element in O(logn).
But Suppose the array is sorted and we just rotate it as per the given example.
sorted array->   1,2,3,4,5
rotated array->  3,4,5,1,2
So now we have to find the element in (logn) complexity. This is the task.
