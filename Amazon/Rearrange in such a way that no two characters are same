Input: aaabc 
Output: abaca 

Input: aaabb
Output: ababa 

Input: aa 
Output: Not Possible

Input: aaaabc 
Output: Not Possible

Logic :
Taking about this input like aab . Here we have enough b to split the aa.
About this aaab. Here we dont have enough b character to seperate all the three a. Here the output would be false.
So, we are trying to seperate most frequently occuring character first. So, for these we have to count that how many times the charcater occurs. And for the most
occuring character we have to seperate that by the second most frequently charcter occur.
