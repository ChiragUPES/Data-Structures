450-> 
Sorting-> 1) Selection Sort-> O(n2)
          2) Bubble Sort->  O(n2)
          3) Merge Sort-> O(nlogn)

Array->   1) Reverse an array->  while(i<=j) {swap}
          2) Max and minimum element of an array 
          3) kth max, kth minimum. -> for maximum value use min heap.
          4) Array Contains 0,1,2 only. Sort the array. -> Approach1: Count the number of 0,1,2. And using loop print the count. 
                                                           Approach2: technique used to seperate the 3 colours. low(indicating 0 ), mid(indicating 1),high(ind 2)
                                                           Both approch will take O(n)
          
          5) Move all the negative to beginning and positive to end. -> Same approch 3 pointer.
          6) union and intersection of two sorted array.-> Technique which is used in merging the two array in merge sort. TC-> O(n+m)
          7) union of two array if it is unsorted.-> using hashmap. TC-> O(n+m)
          8) Rotate by one
          9) Rotate by d value-> first half and second half reverse. Than total reverse.
          10) Contigous sub-array with max sum. (Kadane's Algo.) -> O(n)
          11) Merge Intervals-> O(nlogn)

Matrix->  1) Search in 2D matrix
          2) Spiral Traversal
          3) Row with the maximum 1's
          4) Maximum rectangle in 2D array.
          5) Rotate matrix by 90 degree. (Transpose+reverse each row)

Stack->   1) Next Greater Element on right
          2) Largest area of histogram     

String:   1) Print Permutation of string          





Patterns
Basic->   1) Is a prime?
          2) Print prime between a range
          3) Fibbonaci Series                     (IMPORTANT)
          4) Count digit of the number
          5) Reverse of number
          6) Print digit of number left to right  (IMPORTANT)
          7) Inverse of a Number                  (IMPORTANT)
          8) Rotate of Number                     (IMPORTANT)
          9) GCD(Greatest common divisor and least common multiplier) (IMPORTANT)
         10) factorial
         11) Digit frequency
          
          
          


String->  1) Check Pangram
          2) Missing character that makes string pangram
          3) Two String is equal or not
          4) Check if all the string character are same or not
          5) Removing punctuation from string
          6) Find inital of a name
          7) Duck number or not
          8) Change String to new Character Set (IMPORTANT)
          9) Find Extra Character in a String   (IMPORTANT) (How to traverse through HashMap)
         10) Reverse of a String
         11) Round a given number to nearest multiple of 10

Array->  1) Rotation.
                    1) Rotation of an array
                    2) Rotation of array by one element
                    3) How Many times array is rotated OR Find the minimum element in rotated sorted array (IMPORTANT)
          
          2) Arrangement and Rearrangement
                    1) Moves all the zeros to end
          
          3) Sliding Window  
          4) 2D array-> 1) intro   
                        2) take ip and display
                        3) Matrix Multiplication
          5) Pepcoding:
                        1) Span of array
                        2) Find element in an array
