Scenario is we have 4 card in left hand and we have to sort these cards SO, approach we can use is that we find the minimum card and put it into our right hand.
Than pick the second minimum card and put it into right hand and so on.
same,
arr-> 6,3,8,2 -> find the minimum one and put it into another array-> 2
                 than 3
                 than 6
                 than 8
So, instead of using extra space we can use the same array.
SO, arr-> 2,7,4,1,5,3.
  So find the minimum and instead of put the minimum array into the first position of another array ,we can put it into the first postion of same array.
    arr will be-> 1,7,4,2,5,3
    Now we can scan the elements after the positon 1 and find the second minimum. 
    arr-> 1,2,4,7,5,3
    Now, -> 1,2,3,7,5,4
    Now-> 1,2,3,4,5,7
